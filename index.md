# TerraFirmaCraft API Documentation

Welcome to the API Documentation for the TerraFirmaCraft The Next Generation (TFC-TNG) mod for Minecraft 1.12+

Note: **this is not a wiki!** If you are a player of TFC-TNG, you will not find in-game documentation here. This is for developers of addons and packs using TFC-TNG. For gameplay documentation, consult the [Field-Guide](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/) instead.

Select the documentation for the correct version of the game (and TFC) you are interested in:

- [TFC v3.x for Minecraft 1.20.1](1.20.x/)
- [TFC v2.x for Minecraft 1.18.2](1.18.x/)
- [TFC v1.x for Minecraft 1.12.2](1.12.x/)
