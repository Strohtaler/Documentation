# 1.18.x

This is the documentation for the **2.x.x** version of TFC, currently for **Minecraft 1.18.2**.

### [World Generation](worldgen/)

All of TFC's world generation is available to be customized through vanilla data packs. There are many different pieces, so this will hopefully explain what TFC does, how it does it, and what you can safely modify. (And also, what can be extended with addons or compatibility mods.)

### [Data](data/)

TFC has a large number of crafting recipe types, other recipes, custom data, tags, and more which are also customizable via datapacks. This can be used to add or remove recipes from TFC devices, change or give things TFC-like behavior, or interact with other mods.
