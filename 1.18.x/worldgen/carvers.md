# Configured Carvers

*[Vanilla Reference for Carvers](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Carver_definition)*

TFC adds two variants on vanilla carvers, which are modified to be able to both carve, and replace TFC rock blocks. These blocks are defined in the [dimension](../dimension/) settings.

TFC adds the following carver types:

**Carvers**:

- TFC Cave (`tfc:cave`)
- TFC Canyon (`tfc:canyon`)

Both these carvers have the exact same configuration as the vanilla carvers of the same name, and can be used in an interchangeable fashion. For examples of their configuration, see the above vanilla reference.
