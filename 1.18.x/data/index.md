# Custom Data

In addition to recipes, TFC defines and loads a number of completely custom data types. These can also be loaded by datapacks, and all are under the root path `tfc`, meaning that any added data should be located under `/data/<your mod id>/tfc/<data type name>/...`.

TFC defines the following custom data types:

- [Climate Ranges](#climate-ranges)
- [Drinkables](#drinkables)
- [Fauna](#fauna)
- [Fertilizers](#fertilizers)
- [Food Items](#food-items)
- [Fuels](#fuels)
- [Item Heats](#item-heats)
- [Item Sizes](#item-sizes)
- [Lamp Fuels](#lamp-fuels)
- [Metals](#metals)
- [Supports](#supports)
