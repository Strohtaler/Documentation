# World Generation

Note: this documentation will assume a working knowledge of how both data packs, and custom world generation works in vanilla Minecraft. If you are unfamiliar with those topics, the wiki provides a good starting point to learn about [Data Packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack), and [Custom World Generation](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Custom_world_generation).

TFC adds the `tfc:overworld` [World Preset](https://minecraft.wiki/w/World_preset_definition) which generates TFC terrain, and can be selected both in client and on servers. TFC also adds various biomes, features, decorators, carvers, which can be found below:
